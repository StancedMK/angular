            <h1 class="mt-5">Angular</h1>
                <p>Angular (commonly referred to as "Angular 2+" or "Angular v2 and above") is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework led by the Angular Team at 
                <a href="https://google.lv/" target="_blank">Google</a> 
                and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.
                </p>

            <h2 id="1" class="mt-5">Differences between Angular and AngularJS</h2>
            <hr></hr>
                <p>
                    Google designed Angular as a ground-up rewrite of AngularJS.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Angular does not have a concept of "scope" or controllers, instead it uses a hierarchy of components as its primary architectural characteristic.</li>

                    <li>Angular has a different expression syntax, focusing on <a class="text-danger">"[ ]"</a> for property binding, and <a class="text-danger">"( )"</a> for event binding
                    </li>

                    <li>Modularity – much core functionality has moved to modules</li>

                    <li>Angular recommends the use of Microsoft's TypeScript language, which introduces the following features:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Static typing, including Generics</li>
                            <li>Annotations</li>
                        </ul>

                    </li>

                    <li>TypeScript is a superset of ECMAScript 6 (ES6), and is backwards compatible with ECMAScript 5 (i.e.: JavaScript).</li>

                    <li>Dynamic loading</li>

                    <li>Asynchronous template compilations</li>

                    <li>Iterative callbacks provided by RxJS. RxJS limits state visibility and debugging, but these can be solved with reactive add-ons like ngrx or ngxs.</li>

                    <li>Support for Angular Universal, which runs Angular applications on servers</li>

                </ul>  
                


            <h2 class="mt-5">History</h2>
            <hr></hr>
                <h3 id="2">Naming</h3>
                    <p>
                    Originally, the rewrite of AngularJS was called "Angular 2", but this led to confusion among developers. To clarify, the Team announced that separate terms should be used for each framework with "AngularJS" referring to the 1.X versions and "Angular" without the "JS" referring to versions 2 and up.
                    </p>

                <h3 id="3">Version 2</h3>
                    <p>
                    Angular 2.0 was announced at the ng-Europe conference 22–23. October 2014. The drastic changes in the 2.0 version created considerable controversy among developers. On April 30, 2015, the Angular developers announced that Angular 2 moved from Alpha to Developer Preview. Angular 2 moved to Beta in December 2015, and the first release candidate was published in May 2016. The final version was released on September 14, 2016
                    </p>

                <h3 id="4">Version 4</h3>
                    <p>
                    On 13 December 2016 Angular 4 was announced, skipping 3 to avoid a confusion due to the misalignment of the router package's version which was already distributed as v3.3.0. The final version was released on March 23, 2017. Angular 4 is backward compatible with Angular 2.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Angular version 4.3 is a minor release, meaning that it contains no breaking changes and that it is a drop-in replacement for 4.x.x.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Features in version 4.3
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Introducing HttpClient, a smaller, easier to use, and more powerful library for making HTTP Requests.</li>
                        <li>New router life cycle events for Guards and Resolvers. Four new events: GuardsCheckStart, GuardsCheckEnd, ResolveStart, ResolveEnd join the existing set of life cycle event such as NavigationStart.</li>
                        <li>Conditionally disable animations.</li>
                    </ul>  

                    

                <h3 id="5">Version 5</h3>
                    <p>

                <h3 id="6">Version 6</h3>
                    <p>
                    Angular 6 was released on May 4, 2018. This is a major release focused less on the underlying framework, and more on the toolchain and on making it easier to move quickly with Angular in the future, like: ng update, ng add, Angular Elements, Angular Material + CDK Components, Angular Material Starter Components, CLI Workspaces, Library Support, Tree Shakable Providers, Animations Performance Improvements, and RxJS v6.
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <ul>
